# pokemon-catalog
Display of data from all Pokemon using PokeAPI data. Project that I am doing as a newby with Python for learning purpouses.

In functions.py, the available functions that I have generated can be found:

In python3, execute:

exec(open('code/load.py').read())

Some libraries are needed in order to run this functions. You can find them in code/load.py

The functions that have been generated to date are:

````
plotPokemonCard(mon)

plotEvoLine(chain)

ProfessorOak()

ChampionTeam()
````
